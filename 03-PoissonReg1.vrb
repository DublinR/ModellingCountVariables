\begin{itemize}
\item Each variable has 200 valid observations and their distributions seem quite reasonable.
\item The mean and variance of our outcome variable are more or less the same.
\item Our model assumes that these values, conditioned on the predictor variables, will be equal (or at least roughly so).
\end{itemize}
