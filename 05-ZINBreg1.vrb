\frametitle{Tests of Significance}
\begin{itemize}
\item All of the predictors in both the count and inflation portions of the model are statistically significant.
%\item This model will fit the data significantly better than the null model, i.e., the intercept-only model.
%\item To show that this is the case, we could compare with the current model to a null model without predictors using chi-squared test on the difference of log likelihoods.
\end{itemize}
