\frametitle{Tests of Significance}
\begin{itemize}
\item All of the predictors in both the count and inflation portions of the model are statistically significant.
\item This model will fit the data significantly better than the null model, i.e., the intercept-only model.
\item To show that this is the case, we could compare with the current model to a null model without predictors using chi-squared test on the difference of log likelihoods.
\end{itemize}
