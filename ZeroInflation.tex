	\textbf{Zero-inflated Regression models - Summary}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Zero-inflated models attempt to account for excess zeros. 
		\item In other words, two kinds of zeros are thought to exist in the data, ``\textbf{true zeros}" and ``\textbf{excess zeros}". 
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Two Distinct Processes}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The two parts of the a zero-inflated model are a binary model, usually a logit model to model which of the two processes the zero outcome is associated with and a count model (either a Poisson or negative binomial model) to model the count process. 
		%\item Zero-inflated poisson regression is used to model count data that has an excess of zero counts. 
		\item In other words, the excess zeros are generated by a separate process from the count values and that the excess zeros can be modelled independently. 
		\item Zero-inflated models estimate two equations simultaneously, one for the count model and one for the excess zeros.
\item The expected count is expressed as a combination of the two processes.
		
		% \item Thus, the zip model has two parts, a poisson count model and the logit model for predicting excess zeros.
		%\item You may want to review these Data Analysis Example pages, Poisson Regression and Logit Regression.

	%Let's pursue Example 2 from above.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We have data on 250 groups that went to a park. 
		\item Each group was questioned about how many fish they caught (\textbf{count}), how many children were in the group (\textbf{child}), how many people were in the group (\textbf{persons}), and whether or not they brought a camper to the park (\textbf{camper}).
		\item 
		In addition to predicting the number of fish caught, there is interest in predicting the existence of excess zeros, i.e., the probability that a group caught zero fish.

\frametitle{What is a Zero-Inflated Model?}
\textbf{The Fishing Example}
\begin{itemize}
\item Recall: A zero-inflated model assumes that zero outcome is due to two different processes.

\item For instance, in the example of fishing presented here, the two processes are that a subject has gone 1. \textit{fishing} vs. 2. \textit{not fishing}.
\item If not gone fishing, the only outcome possible is zero. 
\item If gone fishing, it is then a count process. 
\end{itemize}
\begin{framed}
\[E(\mbox{no. fish caught} =k) \]\[=P(\mbox{not fishing})\times 0+P( \mbox{fishing}) \times E(y=k| \mbox{fishing}) \]

%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item In \texttt{R}, zero-inflated count data models can be fitted with the \texttt{zeroinfl()} function from the
%		\textbf{pscl} package. 
%		\item Both the fitting function interface and the returned model objects of class
%		``\texttt{zeroinfl()}`` are  modelled
%		after the corresponding GLM functionality in \texttt{R}.
